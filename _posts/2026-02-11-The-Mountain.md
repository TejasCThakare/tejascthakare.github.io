I am seeing one mountain from very far, very far. I don’t know what that mountain is. I have been seeing it since my childhood. I have seen its phases: it being clear in summer, blurry in fog, invisible in rain. I have heard its stories from many, its description, its difficult attainability. People just describe it.

I want to go to that mountain, but it’s very far. I have heard from people that there is no fixed, defined route which guarantees that if I follow it, I will be reaching there. But I am already on that journey with only one thing in my wet eyes, silent lips but a loud heart: I have to attain that mountain in any condition. I have been walking, walking on the way. I got lost, falling, settling sometimes with small mountains on the way, but the sight of that mountain is still there. I could still see it; it makes me walk. I don’t know the proper way to the mountain, which way, but I am trying some ways. Some bring me closer, some again take me farther.

Sometimes I lose sight of the mountain, and sometimes when I see it, I find it farther. There is no one to guide me. I am on my journey. I don’t know how, but I will find the proper way to the mountain. All I can do is walk, walk faithfully and have belief in myself and God, and walk as long as I am moving and not losing that desire. I am already moving toward it. Yes, there is no defined pathway. I am finding it on my own, and I will find it. I will find it because I have to reach that mountain anyway.
