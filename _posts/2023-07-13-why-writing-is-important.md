Many things go on throughout the day in our thoughts, most of which we are unaware and that reflects in our actions. One’s personality is not localized to a certain point; instead, there is a spread in nature from some average behavior. I consider individual personality like an onion having many layers. Writing down what we do or have done daily makes us aware of our own traits and helps us understand the layers of personalities. The spread of thoughts becomes narrower, and that brings about clarity. [Jordan Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/about/) says, “You can do an awful lot by writing down what happened to you and thinking it through.” So far, I have observed that writing changes the direction of the thought process. The way we write a story about ourselves; changes our thoughts accordingly and thus actions. For example, If one feels low or incompetent for doing a particular thing then, start by writing down how one is feeling and thinking about it, then write down a story that includes elevated words, positive sentences about oneself, etc. - That story changes thought patterns. It makes one in sync with the written story and reflects in thoughts and actions (experiment with it). One of the best gifts I can give to someone is to make them write.
