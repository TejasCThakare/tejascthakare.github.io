>I came across one unknown greenish jungle. I wondered! I parked my cycle near the tree<br/> 
and slowly rushed into it. I began to hear one unknown, diminished but soulful music.<br/> 
 With each increasing step, that sound's intensity was amplifying.Curiously, I was following <br/>
that spontaneous path which was seeming like the road to salvation. At one point, far <br/>
from everything, I saw one little house carved into greenish walls at the base of the cliff. <br/>
With that unknown music, I moved several steps ahead. Oh, gosh! I saw several dwarf<br/>
people playing, laughing, and living. No one seemed to have the quality of greed, jealousy,<br/>
or pride. All were living in absolute joy. Suddenly, One dwarf little child caught me.<br/> 
Despite knowing one unknown boy was in their place, they smiled at me and I...and I <br/>
smiled back. And leaving behind the old world, I went with them for an Adventure...I was <br/>
still feeling that unknown divine music coming from an unknown source...
