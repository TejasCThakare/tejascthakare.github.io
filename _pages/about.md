> I'm Tejas, currently working as a Data Scientist. I hold a Master of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), and a Master of Science in Physics from [IIT Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/).  My areas of interest include AI/ML. I’m passionate about applying AI to solve complex real-world problems. I rather emphasis on solution driven approach through hard work than struggling with problem through merely talent, knowledge, intelligence or self validation. Outside of work, I enjoy discussing ideas, traveling, listening to music, reading, and writing. Please reach me out if you have any opportunity or suggestions for me.
