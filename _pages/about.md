> I'm Tejas Chandrakant Thakare; currently pursuing Master of Technology in Electrical Engineering @ [Department Of Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/) of [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). My areas of interest are ML/DL, AI, Data Science, NLP and Computer Vision. Currently, I am doing my MTech project at Computational Imaging Lab of IIT Madras, where I am working on Gaussian Splatting and NeRF. I completed Master of Science in Physics from [IIT Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) in may, 2023. I rather emphasis on solution driven approach through hard work than struggling with problem through merely talent, knowledge, intelligence or self validation. I enjoy learning computational and blend of experimental and theoretical stuffs. I also love discussing ideas, listening music, travelling , short reading and writing.  Please reach me out if you have any opportunity or suggestions for me.
