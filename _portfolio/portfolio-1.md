I was at the last semester of my MSc at IIT Bhubaneswar. It was bit hecting time since i was doing my project  and filled with question now what will I do after MSc?However, during my msc periond i got interested into pure tech field..till that point of time i was doing rigourous mathematics/theorotcal phyisc (If i may say I was doing fancy stuffs). I wanted to make the trasiotio to the tech background specially in AI. I had alrady decided to do M.Tech and admisson to mtech in iits/nits obviusly requires gate score. I was already in the last sem and was caught up with project and gate exam was just 14-15 days away... i remeber on fine morning i woke up and dont know what happened i decided to cracke gate one more time  with good score (I had already cracked GATE before joining MSc) enough to land to good institute and Data Science or some technical backgrouubd (In any way i wanted to join technical course so that i could make transition into tech world specially again, AI :smile:)
 So I grabbed myself and started preparing for the GATE from morning to the night and had to handle the project also  (I remebered it was like End Game's Cap when he tighnes the grip of the schild and says ..Avenger Assenble here it was ..Tejas Assemble :laughing:). GATE Score came and i got chill because i knew i will land up into the good MTech programm that too in IIT (Again! ðŸ˜†). I appliead to the several iits and got various mtech offers. The first offer i got was from iit-bhu but it was some metallugical engiinering so i rejected that offer. Then i got offer from iit delh's mtech Atmospheric-Oceanic Science & Technology. I was very happy and excited to know gret- iit delhi! however i waited for the other offers and then i got the offer from iit madras. Initially i was not hesitant to choose iit madras over iit delhi but my father suggested and also seeing iit madras reputation (NIRF-1 ðŸ˜Ž)  i enrolled into iit madras. So finally i took admiison into iitm's mtech prgrame in Electrical Engineering! Now, question was i never studied the circuit/electronics propely due to my physics background and plus i did not like to the study the curcuits or may i never gave enough attention to it before...now in first mtech first sem i had one core course on analog and digital curcuits and since now i m electrical engineerin so all other peoples in the electrical deptarment are from btech background doing mtech so naturally they were finding it less hard. Howver , here i was struggling the professor assumed everyone has proper touched with ciruite or electronics in their btechs. So i had to struggle in lectures however i was already devoting 1hr to study the electronics and ciruits from sctrach and making proper notes using two colors. However, In my first quizz of analog and digital i got 5 marks out of 20.. i guess it was second lowest in the class ðŸ˜†. Then I got bit tensed that i have done this much still i got this marks..but after the first quizz i prepared with my same approach devoting proper time where i find difficult to cope up with the course and importanyly there was one special fellow who taught me digital electronic concept and  it really helped me and in the second quizz i got 18 marks out of 20 ... it was like some movies scene of comeback ðŸ˜†. IIT Madras is the cool institure both in academics and in social activites. Since i completed the most of core course in first sem then it was now turn of electives course in the second semester..i choose courses related to the data scieenc and the AI. It was bit risky since those course were one of the hard courses of iit madras. However i took risks and completed the all courses. In my third semester, I joined the [Prof. Kaushik Mitra's](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/) [Computational Imaging lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) for my MTech Thesis (Ongoing). My MTech project is on the 3D High Dynamich RAnge reconsstruction of static and dynamic images using the gaussian splatting...Its very cool topic with application to AR/VR technologies. I mean sometimes it feels like a dream to me that once i dreamt of doing mtech into ai but landed into electrical however found middle way to the field of data science and ai through iit madras's great curriculum/academic structure which allowed me to explore what i like...this instituuion has changed my life to great extent both academically and personally I will alwys be gratefull towards the institute.
