I was at the last semester of my MSc at IIT Bhubaneswar. It was bit hecting time since i was doing my project  and simulatenouly was preparing GATE exam..during my msc periond i got interested into pure tech field..till that point of time i was doing rigourous mathematics/theorotcal phyisc (If i may say I was doing fancy stuffs). I wanted to make the trasiotio to the tech background specially in AI. I had alrady decided to do M.Tech and admisson to mtech in iits/nits obviusly requires gate score. I was already in the last sem and was caught up with project and gate exam was just 14-15 days away... i remeber on fine morning i woke up and dont know what happened i decided to cracke gate one more time  with good score (I had already cracked GATE before joining MSc) enough to land to good institute and Data Science or some technical backgrouubd in any way i wanted to join technical course so that i could make transition into tech world specially again, AI :smile:
 I grabbed tightly (I remebered it was like End Games Cap when he tighnes the grip of the schild and says ..Avenger Assenble here it was ..Tejas Assemble :laughing:
)
