I was in the last semester of my MSc at IIT Bhubaneswar. It was quite a hectic time since I was working on my project and constantly questioning what I would do after my MSc. However, during my MSc period, I developed an interest in the pure tech field. Until that point, I had been deeply involved in rigorous mathematics and theoretical physics (if I may say, I was doing fancy stuff). I wanted to transition into the tech industry, specifically AI.

I had already decided to pursue an MTech, and admission to MTech programs at IITs/NITs obviously required a good GATE score. Since I was in my last semester and occupied with my project, the GATE exam was just 14-15 days away. I remember one fine morning when I woke up and, wildly, decided to crack GATE one more time with a good score. (I had already cleared GATE before joining my MSc.) My goal was to secure admission to a reputed institute in Data Science or a technical background‚Äîone way or another, I wanted to join a technical course to transition into the tech world, especially AI. üòä

So, I pulled myself together and started preparing for GATE from morning to night while also managing my project. (It was like Captain America in *Endgame* when he tightens his shield and says, "Avengers Assemble!" For me, it was "Tejas Assemble!" üòÇ). When the GATE results came in, I was thrilled because I knew I would land in a good MTech program at an IIT (again! üòÜ).

I applied to several IITs and received multiple MTech offers. The first offer was from IIT-BHU, but it was for Metallurgical Engineering, so I rejected it. Then, I got an offer from IIT Delhi‚Äôs MTech in Atmospheric-Oceanic Science & Technology. I was very excited‚Äîafter all, it was IIT Delhi! However, I waited for other offers and eventually received an offer from IIT Madras. Initially, I was hesitant to choose IIT Madras over IIT Delhi, but my father suggested considering IIT Madras‚Äô reputation (NIRF Rank 1 üòé). So, I decided to enroll at IIT Madras for my MTech in Electrical Engineering!

Now, the challenge was that I had never properly studied circuits or electronics due to my physics background. Plus, I never really liked studying circuits‚Äîor perhaps I never gave them enough attention. In my first MTech semester, I had a core course on Analog and Digital Circuits. Since I was now an Electrical Engineering student, most of my peers were from BTech backgrounds, making it relatively easier for them. However, I struggled since the professor assumed everyone had prior knowledge of circuits or electronics.

Determined not to fall behind, I dedicated an hour daily to studying electronics and circuits from scratch, making detailed notes using two colors. Despite my efforts, in the first quiz of Analog and Digital Circuits, I scored just 5 out of 20‚ÄîI think it was the second-lowest in the class! üòÜ That made me anxious, as I had put in so much effort but still scored poorly. However, after that first quiz, I continued my approach, dedicating extra time to my weak areas. Most importantly, one special fellow helped me understand digital electronics concepts, which really helped. In the second quiz, I scored 18 out of 20‚Äîit felt like a classic movie comeback moment! üòÜ

IIT Madras is an amazing institute, both academically and socially. Since I had completed most of my core courses in the first semester, I focused on electives in the second semester. I chose courses related to Data Science and AI. These were some of the toughest courses at IIT Madras, but I took the risk and successfully completed them.

In my third semester, I joined [Prof. Kaushik Mitra's](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/) [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) for my MTech thesis. My MTech project focuses on 3D High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction of static and dynamic images using Gaussian Splatting. It‚Äôs a fascinating topic with applications in AR/VR technologies. Sometimes, it feels surreal‚Äîonce, I dreamed of pursuing AI but ended up in Electrical Engineering. However, thanks to IIT Madras‚Äô flexible curriculum and academic structure, I finally found my way into Data Science and AI.

This institution has significantly shaped my life, both academically and personally. I will always be grateful to IIT Madras. Well, all of this required a leap of faith and hard work. As we say in Marathi, *"‡§ï‡•á‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§π‡•ã‡§§ ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á ‡§∞‡•á, ‡§Ü‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•á‡§≤‡•á‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§™‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§ú‡•á"*, which means *"It gets done by doing; it should be done first."*
