Take the phone camera, point it to the scene where there are lights sources and also darkness (i.e. proper coverag of all intensities) and then capture it. The captured pic will have high saturation around the captured light sources and nearly invisible or partially visible areas where there is low intensity. Go to expsoure adjument setting and cputre same scene with different exposure setting like from -2,-1,0,1,2 (The above image is captured in iphone14  at  the -2 expsosure). There is simple relation of expusre value and photons. The scene is captured by the record of photon hits on the camera sensor. The captured intensity in the image through sensor is dirrectly proportional to the time for which the camera shutter remain open and hence exposure. So, exposure ∝ the photon falling on camera sensor ∝ intenisity recorded in the image for the partifcular scene. However, the the exposure time is long then the camera sensor records more photons beyond sensors capactiy to accomodate the photons and we get the sauration in the intensity of bright scene and the areas which are dark gets well exposed. Similary,when expsoure time is low then sensor recieves the less photon and darker areas get unexposed and brighter areas of scnee gets properlye exposed. So we get stack of images of same scene at differnet exposure values  with varying intnirty.
