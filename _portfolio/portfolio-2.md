Take the phone camera, point it to the scene where there are lights sources and also darkness (i.e. proper coverag of all intensities) and then capture it. The captured pic will have high saturation around the captured light sources and nearly invisible or partially visible areas where there is low intensity. Go to expsoure adjument setting and cputre same scene with different exposure setting like from -2,-1,0,1,2 (The above image is captured in iphone14  at  the -2 expsosure). There is simple relation of expusre value and photons. The scene is captured by the record of photon hits on the camera sensor. The captured intensity in the image through sensor is dirrectly proportional to the time for which the camera shutter remain open and hence exposure. So, exposure ∝ the photon falling on camera sensor ∝ intenisity recorded in the image for the partifcular scene. Generally speaking, .png or .jpg or .jpeg images are in 8-bits (i.e. camera sensor can take any RGB value recorded upto 0 to 2⁸-1=255). If exposure time is long then the camera sensor records more photons beyond sensors capactiy to accomodate the photons and we get the sauration in the intensity of bright scene and the areas which are dark gets well exposed. Similary,when expsoure time is low then sensor recieves the less photon and darker areas get unexposed and brighter areas of scnee gets properlye exposed. So we get stack of images of same scene at differnet exposure values with varying intnirty. This images are called as Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images because, they dont contain all the true radiance of the real captured scene. Using this varied expusre images we can get an single High Dynamic Range (HDR) image of the scene with all the intensities propely exposued using varouus exposure stacking methodssuch as Mertern method, devemec , etc or Deep Learning based methods like CNN, GAN models, etc which can be trained on the multiexposure images data and with or without corresponding Ground Truth HDR Image and learns to predicte the HDR image of any LDR image.
